# Brew Crew
An application that is designed to take in orders from users in an office to allow a person taking coffee orders to make the right cup for each office user. This app works for a single office.

This application was made by following a tutorial by [The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheNetNinja) on using [Flutter and Firebase](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9j--TKIdkb3ISfRbJeJYQwC).
## What I learnt
Having grasped the basics from my [World Time App](https://github.com/chirambaht/Flutter-Example-World-Time-App), I added to my knowledge:
- Firebase usage (Firestore and Authentication)
- Streams and Providers to constantly pass data that as it is updated in real time
- Modelling for mobile applications
